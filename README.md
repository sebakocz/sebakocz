### Yo, it's Sebas! ðŸ‘‹

- :telescope: Currently working on: deck tool for Poxnora (because who doesn't love a good strategy game?)
- :seedling: Learning: new coding techniques to take my card game tools to the next level
- :dancers: Looking to collaborate on: analytics tool of some sorts (I love my mana curves)
- :speech_balloon: Ask me about: any collectible card game you can think of - I love them all!
- :black_joker: Fun fact: I once traded a rare card for a pizza (it was totally worth it)

Thanks for stopping by my profile - let's d-d-d-duel!
